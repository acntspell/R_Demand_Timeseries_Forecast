# README for GFD Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This R script performs a comprehensive time series analysis and forecasting for call volume data of a specific station. It incorporates various methods, including ARIMA, ETS models, and more traditional techniques like naive and seasonal naive approaches.

## Libraries Used

- `tidyverse`: For data manipulation and visualization.
- `forecast`: Provides methods and tools for displaying and analysing univariate time series forecasts including exponential smoothing via state space models and automatic ARIMA modelling.
- `readxl`: Used to read data from Excel files.
- `ggplot2`: For creating plots.
- `seasonal`: Interface to X-13-ARIMA-SEATS, a seasonal adjustment software.
- `lubridate`: For easier handling of dates within R.
- `plotly`: For interactive plots.

## Data Handling

- Data is read from Excel files containing response information and monthly calls, with preprocessing steps that include filtering and transforming the data based on various criteria such as station and incident type.
- Data is then adjusted for COVID-19 impact by calculating and applying a percentage reduction factor based on the comparison of response volumes between 2019 and 2020.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Importation**: Initial data is imported and preprocessed.
2. **Variable Construction**: New variables are constructed such as `Month_Date` to facilitate time series analysis.
3. **Data Summarization**: Data is summarized by month and station.
4. **COVID Adjustment**: Adjustments are made to account for the impact of COVID-19 on call volumes.
5. **Time Series Forecasting**:
   - Simple models (naive, seasonal naive, drift, mean).
   - ETS models for error, trend, and seasonality.
   - ARIMA models for autoregressive integrated moving average processes.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Each model is assessed using accuracy metrics against a test set.
7. **Decomposition**: Time series decomposition techniques are applied to further understand underlying patterns.
8. **Combined Forecasting**: Forecasts from different models are combined to improve accuracy.
9. **Interactive Visualization**: Final visualizations are created using `plotly` for interactive exploration.

## Output Files

- `GFD_Simple.csv`: Contains filtered and simplified data.
- `GFD_Sum.csv`: Summarized data by month and station.

## Running the Script

Ensure all required libraries are installed in R using `install.packages()`. The script can be run in an R environment capable of executing R scripts, such as RStudio.

## Note

The script assumes the presence of specific columns and structure in the input Excel files. Any changes in the structure of these files might require modifications to the script.
